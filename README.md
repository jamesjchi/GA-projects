Project 1 - Black Jack - First Draft of a Black Jack game that increasingly became more complex than I originally imagined.
I decided to build it from scratch using my limited knowledge of coding for now just to see if I could do it.
Later on in the process I realized that my method of creating random cards would create duplicates and I found out that it'd be better to create an array of cards initially to draw from. However, this would mean that I'd probably have to redo most of my code to reflect this. I am currently trying to rebuild it with this methodology but as of now, I have posted my somewhat working game, albeit messy code, to github for now. Here's to continuing to learn!
