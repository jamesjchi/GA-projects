## Project 1: BlackJack

I built this over the course of about 3 days and with 2 weeks worth of learning how to code.
This was great for attempting to figure out how to write some basic logic. I quickly realized that even though it sounds
simple to build, once you start you realize all the different logic checks you need to do to make something happen.
Even though it works with the base game, there are definitely more features I'd like to add to make it more viable.
Also some of my code is pretty messy but what can you do.
